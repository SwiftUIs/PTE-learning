The image is a donut chart showing social media usage preferences by age group.
Overall, younger age groups account for a larger proportion of social media usage.
The 18 to 24 age group represents about 22.6 percent, which is the highest figure, closely followed by the 25 to 34 group at approximately 22.1 percent.
Usage then declines among middle-aged users, with the 35 to 44 group at around 13.2 percent and the 45 to 54 group at about 11.6 percent.
Older age groups show lower usage, as people aged 55 to 64 account for roughly 16.7 percent, while those aged 65 and above make up about 13.8 percent.
In conclusion, the chart clearly indicates that social media usage is more popular among younger people than older adults.
