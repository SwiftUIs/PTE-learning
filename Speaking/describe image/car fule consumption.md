The image is a line graph illustrating car fuel consumption from 2000 to 2020, measured in liters per 100 kilometers.
Overall, fuel consumption fluctuates significantly over the years.
It starts at around 12.6 liters in 2000 and then drops sharply to its lowest point of approximately 5.4 liters in 2004.
After that, consumption increases and peaks at about 14.4 liters in 2007, followed by another decline to around 9 liters in 2010.
From 2011 to 2014, fuel consumption remains relatively high, reaching another peak of roughly 14.2 liters.
In the final period, it rises again to about 14 liters in 2019 before falling dramatically to around 6.7 liters in 2020.
In conclusion, the graph shows a highly variable trend in car fuel consumption over time.
