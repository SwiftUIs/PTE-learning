People hold different views on the primary purpose of education. Some believe that education should prepare individuals for future employment and help them become responsible members of society, while others argue that it should focus on personal growth and self-fulfillment. In my opinion, education should serve both purposes, as they are equally important and closely connected.

On the one hand, preparing students for the workforce is an essential function of education. Schools and universities equip learners with practical skills, professional knowledge, and critical thinking abilities that enable them to secure employment and contribute productively to society. In addition, education plays a key role in shaping moral values, social responsibility, and civic awareness, which are necessary for maintaining social stability and cooperation. Without these foundations, individuals may struggle to adapt to modern economic and social demands.

On the other hand, education should not be limited to job preparation alone. Self-fulfillment is a fundamental human need, and education provides individuals with opportunities to explore their interests, develop creativity, and build confidence. Subjects such as art, literature, and philosophy encourage independent thinking and emotional development, helping students gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. This personal growth often leads to greater motivation and long-term success.

In conclusion, education should aim to prepare individuals for employment while also promoting self-fulfillment. A balanced educational approach not only produces skilled workers but also nurtures well-rounded, fulfilled individuals who can make meaningful contributions to society.
