**There are certain activities that may not be suitable for the elderly. Please cite examples of such activities along with the maximum suitable age for these activities.**

As people grow older, physical strength and cognitive abilities may gradually decline, making certain activities less suitable for elderly individuals. Although age limits can vary depending on personal health, some activities generally require a level of fitness that becomes harder to maintain with age.

One example is extreme sports such as skydiving or rock climbing. These activities demand strong muscles, quick reflexes, and excellent balance. For most individuals, the maximum suitable age for participating in such high-risk sports is around 60 to 65 years old, after which the risk of injury increases significantly.

Another activity that may be unsuitable for the elderly is long-distance marathon running. Endurance sports place heavy stress on the heart and joints. While some exceptional seniors remain capable, for the majority of people, participating in full marathons beyond the age of 65 may pose serious health risks.

Driving for long hours, especially at night, is also challenging for older adults. Reduced eyesight and slower reaction times can increase the likelihood of accidents. For safety reasons, long-distance or night-time driving is generally less suitable after the age of 70.

In conclusion, although age alone should not strictly limit participation in activities, it is important to consider physical and mental health. Setting general age guidelines helps protect elderly individuals from unnecessary risks while encouraging safer alternatives.
