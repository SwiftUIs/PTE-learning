To a large extent, a person’s success is determined more by **hard work** than by **natural talent**, although both factors contribute in different ways.

Natural talent can provide individuals with an initial advantage. People who are born with certain abilities, such as intelligence, physical strength, or creativity, often find it easier to learn skills in specific fields. This early progress may increase confidence and motivation, which can be beneficial at the beginning of a career. For instance, a naturally talented athlete may outperform others in early training stages.

However, long-term success depends largely on sustained effort rather than innate ability. Hard work enables individuals to improve their skills, overcome weaknesses, and adapt to challenges. Many highly successful people have achieved their goals through consistent practice, discipline, and perseverance rather than exceptional talent. In contrast, individuals who rely solely on talent may fail to progress if they lack commitment and resilience.

Overall, while natural talent may influence the starting point, hard work plays a more decisive role in determining success. Talent can create opportunities, but it is continuous effort that allows individuals to maintain progress and achieve lasting accomplishments.
