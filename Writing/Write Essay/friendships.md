**Essay:**

The Internet has significantly altered the way people form and maintain friendships, transforming social interactions from primarily face-to-face encounters to digitally mediated connections. In my view, this change has been substantial, bringing both clear advantages and notable challenges.

One major way the Internet has changed friendship formation is by removing geographical and social barriers. Through social media platforms, online communities, and messaging applications, people can easily connect with others who share similar interests, regardless of location. As a result, friendships can now develop more quickly and among a wider range of individuals than ever before. This is particularly beneficial for people who are shy, busy, or living far from friends and family.

In addition, the Internet has made it easier to maintain friendships over time. Instant messaging, video calls, and social networking sites allow people to stay in frequent contact, even when separated by long distances. These tools help maintain emotional bonds and keep relationships active, which might otherwise weaken due to physical separation.

However, the Internet has also introduced some drawbacks. Online friendships may lack depth, as digital communication often replaces meaningful face-to-face interaction. Moreover, excessive reliance on online communication can reduce real-world social skills and lead to feelings of loneliness or superficial connections.

In conclusion, the Internet has profoundly changed how friendships are formed and maintained. While it offers convenience and broader social opportunities, it also challenges the quality and authenticity of human relationships. Therefore, a balanced use of online and offline interaction is essential for healthy friendships.
