It is often argued that students who obtain university degrees usually earn higher salaries than those without academic qualifications, and therefore they should pay the full cost of their education. In my opinion, while graduates do benefit financially from higher education, it is unreasonable to place the entire financial burden on individuals.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that higher education significantly improves a person’s earning potential. University graduates tend to have better job opportunities, higher income, and more stable careers. From this perspective, asking students to contribute more to their tuition fees seems fair, as education can be seen as a personal investment that brings long-term financial returns. If students pay for their own courses, governments can also reduce public spending and allocate resources to other important areas such as healthcare or infrastructure.

On the other hand, making students pay the full cost of their courses may create serious social inequality. Talented students from low-income families may be discouraged from pursuing higher education due to financial pressure, regardless of their abilities. This would result in a loss of potential skilled workers and limit social mobility. Moreover, society as a whole benefits from an educated population, as graduates contribute to economic growth, innovation, and public services. Therefore, it is reasonable for governments to share part of the educational costs.

In conclusion, although graduates often earn higher salaries, higher education should not be entirely self-funded. A balanced approach, in which students pay part of the cost while governments provide financial support, is the most effective and fair solution.
