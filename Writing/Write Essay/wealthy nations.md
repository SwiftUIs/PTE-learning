**Wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?**

In today’s globalized world, the gap between rich and poor countries is becoming increasingly serious. Some people believe that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer countries. I largely agree with this view, although it should be done in a reasonable and responsible way.

On the one hand, rich countries have more resources, advanced technology and strong economies, while many poor countries struggle to meet basic needs such as food, healthcare and education. If wealthy nations provide financial aid, medical support and educational assistance, it can help reduce poverty and improve living standards. For example, international aid can help build schools and hospitals, which benefits long-term development. In addition, helping poorer countries can promote global stability and reduce problems such as conflict and illegal migration.

On the other hand, simply giving money is not always effective. If aid is not managed properly, it may be wasted or lead to corruption. Poorer countries also need to take responsibility for using support wisely and improving their own systems. Therefore, wealthy nations should focus not only on financial aid, but also on sharing knowledge, skills and technology to help poorer countries become self-sufficient.

In conclusion, I agree that wealthy nations should share their wealth with poorer countries to a large extent. However, this support should be well-planned and focused on sustainable development rather than short-term assistance.
